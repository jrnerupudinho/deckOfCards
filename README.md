# Blackjack 
This project is a single-player Blackjack game written in JavaScript.

Goal:

The goal of the game is to beat the dealer by getting a hand closer to 21 without going over. You can achieve this by:

1. Hitting (drawing another card) to increase your hand value.
2. Staying (keeping your current hand) and hoping it's higher than the dealer's hand.

Output

The program will simulate a Blackjack game and display the following information:

1. Your current hand and its value.
2. The dealer's face-up card and a placeholder for their hidden card.
3. Prompts to "Hit" or "Stay" based on your turn.
4. The final outcome of the game, indicating who won (player, dealer, or tie) and the final hand values.

How to Play

1. Run the HTML file containing the JavaScript code (e.g., index.html).
2. Click "Deal" to start a new game.
3. Choose to "Hit" or "Stay" based on your hand value and your strategy.
4. The game will automatically calculate the winner and display the final outcome.

Note:

This is a basic implementation of Blackjack and doesn't include features like splitting cards or doubling down. For the first deck of cards, the player cards would be on the left and the right would be for dealer cards. After pressing the hit-button you will see cards of the player first and cards of the dealer after the player cards.
